# Stadswandelingen Amsterdam - Leaflet (React)

In this project I attempted to create a Geo Webapplication using open data. My goal was to create an application that makes it possible to create a walk route between points of interest. The map was created for Amsterdam, the capital of The Netherlands. The points of interest consists of cultural and historic places in Amsterdam.

These places are:
- Architecture
- Art (Statues, Glassart etc.)
- Musea & Galleries
- Monuments (Mostly bridges, Amsterdam houses excluded because almost all houses in the center of the city are monumental buildings)
- Religion (Churches, Mosques & Temples)
- Wallart
- Caf√©s & Restaurants
- Public Transit
